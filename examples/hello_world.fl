.. Initialize an array with numbers 1 through 10
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

.. Variable to hold the sum of even numbers
sum = 0

.. Counter variable for the while loop
i = 0

.. While loop to iterate through the array
w i ls 10 
{
    .. Check if the current number is even
    if a[i] % 2 eq 0
    {
        sum = sum + a[i]  .. Add even number to sum
    }
    
    i = i + 1  .. Increment counter
}

.. Print the sum of even numbers
p sum
